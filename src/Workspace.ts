/**
 * A Workspace is defined in this context as a development environment and is a composition of:
 * + Code : a directory containing source code (and later during the development process it will 
 *          also contain dependencies and generated artifacts).
 * + Runtimes : applications required during the development process to code/test the applications.
 *              In this context, all runtimes are volatile and they should not hold state in their filesystems.
 *              Only volumes can be used to preserve data between workspace executions.
 *      * Services : required applications that will be started at the begining of the start up process
 *                   for example: databases.
 *      * Tools : after all services are started any tool can also be started and in general provide some
 *                web content to explore/manipulate code or data services, for example : IDE, db managers.
 * Workspaces are isolated between each other, and can be identified by its workspaceId in the given environment :
 *  * local/remote docker engine
 *  * a docker swarm
 *  * 
 * Team : Workspaces can be grouped in order to provide visibitily whithin the group.
 * Each runtime can access to each other by runtime name and also can see the Code directory and manipulate it.
 * 
 * A Workspace can be either local or remote, so no access to client filesystem is allowed.
 * 
 * 
 * The implementation map these concepts with the following modules :
 * * CodeVolume: a volume named like the workspaceId.
 * * Runtimes: docker containers for Services and Tools with at least one volume pointing Code, and named acording to its definition and workspaceId.
 * * WorkspaceNetwork: a docker network named like the workspaceId providing visibitily between runtimes of the same workspace.
 * * TeamNetwork: a grouping network that provide visibitily to workspaces of the same Team.
 * * Proxy: reverse proxy to access web application tools and services for earch registered workspace
